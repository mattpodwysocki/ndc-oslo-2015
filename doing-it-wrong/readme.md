# Async and Streaming JavaScript, Are We All Doing It Wrong? #

This is a presentation of [Async and Streaming JavaScript, Are We All Doing It Wrong?](http://ndcoslo.oktaset.com/t-30174) at [NDC Oslo 2015](http://www.ndcoslo.com/).

## Outline

On a dark and fateful day, Promises were adopted as the default asynchronous implementation in JavaScript, much to the chagrin of Node community and the church of small modules. So, now we're stuck with it, but was it the right idea? Let's go over that and other asynchronous patterns. From there we will look at Streams and Event patterns for asynchronous and push based information. Is there anything we can learn from that and what about the implementations like Node Streams and WHATWG Streams. Then we'll dissect them and find out how they're wrong and how we can fix them to a better future, but no promises!
