# Reactive Programming Demystified #

This is a presentation of [Reactive Programming Demystified](http://ndcoslo.oktaset.com/t-30175) at [NDC Oslo 2015](http://www.ndcoslo.com/).

## Outline

Reactive Programming has been a hot topic as of late, with such things as the Coursera Course taught by Martin Odersky and Erik Meijer, as well as the [Reactive Manfiesto](http://www.reactivemanifesto.org/). We see many frameworks such as FlapJax, RxJS, Bacon.JS for middleware, and then on the front end on the web, we start to see UI frameworks such as ReactJS from Facebook, [Angular](http://angularjs.org), [Ember.js](http://emberjs.org) and [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/), and on the back end with [Rx.NET](https://github.com/reactive-extensions/rx.net), RxJava, and Akka. This word Reactive becomes very confusing as it quickly loses its meaning. What exactly does Reactive mean? A simple definition of Reacting to input, events, load, etc is not enough. In this talk, we'll explore some of the basics of Reactive Programming, and explore all the frameworks and languages and how they really are the future of web development.
